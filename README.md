## Introduction
The Datadog AWS Threat Emulation Guide is designed to simplify the process of evaluating Datadog's Cloud SIEM security capabilities to detect AWS threats and alert in real time by simulating attacks using [Stratus Red Team](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team).

## Prerequisites
- A functional Datadog trial or production environment with:
    - [Cloud SIEM enabled](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/cloud_siem/)
    - [AWS CloudTrail logging](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/cloud_siem/guide/aws-config-guide-for-cloud-siem/)
- AWS Sandbox account - Stratus Red Team is supposed to be used against a sandbox cloud account that does not handle production workloads or infrastructure.
- An endpoint for installing Stratus Red Team and executing attack techniques against AWS infrastructure.
    - Stratus [supports](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/user-guide/getting-started/) MacOS, Linux, Windows & Docker.
- Prior AWS authentication via cli using either `aws-vault` or static credentials in `~/.aws/config` with `AdministratorAccess`


***Although Stratus Red Team supports attacks for other platforms including Azure, Google Cloud and Kubernetes, this guide is currenty limited to AWS.***

## Installation
To install Stratus Red Team within your threat emulation environment, follow the [Stratus Red Team installation guide](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/user-guide/getting-started/#installation).

## Emulating Attacks

### Detonate all attacks
Utilizing the **stratus.sh** script you can detonate all available stratus attacks in one go. Bear in mind that this process takes around 30 mins to complete.

### Detonate individual attacks

Alternatively, you can detonate the stratus attacks individually as shown below.

- Detonate an attack technique:
```
stratus detonate aws.exfiltration.s3-backdoor-bucket-policy
```

- Detonate multiple attack techniques:
```
stratus detonate aws.exfiltration.s3-backdoor-bucket-policy aws.defense-evasion.cloudtrail-stop
```

- Detonate an attack technique, then automatically clean up any resources deployed on AWS
```
stratus detonate aws.exfiltration.s3-backdoor-bucket-policy --cleanup
```

### Cleanup 
- Cleanup a specific attack technique
```
stratus cleanup aws.defense-evasion.cloudtrail-stop
```

- Cleanup all detonated attack techniques
```
stratus cleanup --all
```


For more details on usage, refer to the [Stratus Red Team Usage Guide](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/user-guide/usage/) and [Stratus Red Team Command Reference](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/user-guide/commands/)

## Validating Detections
***Note that Datadog's OOTB Cloud SIEM Rules are **not** limited to the attack techniques available from Stratus Red Team.***

Within the Datadog app, navigate to **Security** > **Cloud SIEM** > **Signals** and filter by `source:cloudtrail @http.useragent:*stratus-red-team*` in order to validate the signals generated by the emulation.

You should expect the following the detections for the corresponding detonated Stratus Techniques:
